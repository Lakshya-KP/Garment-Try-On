Semantic Layout Generator (SLG):

A U-Net-based SLG, G layout, predicts detailed semantic segmentation of the image based on neutral garment images, initial layouts, and poses.
Training involves pairs of neutral garment images and images of models wearing that garment, guided by pixel-wise cross-entropy loss and LSGAN loss.

Multi-Warp Garment Generator (MGG): The Warping Module:

The MGG, G garment, includes a warper and an inpainting module.
The warper aligns the garment image with the semantic layout using multiple coordinated warps, controlled by distance transform features.
The inpainting module generates the final image using warps, predicted semantic layout, skin color, and an incomplete model image.

Multi-Warp Garment Generator (MGG): The Inpainting Module:

The inpainting module is trained using cascade loss, L1 loss, perceptual loss, and Spectral Norm GAN with hinge loss.
Modifications from the original OVNet, such as excluding garment types during training, lead to significant improvements.

Residual Enhancement:

Residual enhancement ensures generated images show garment detail at the highest resolution.
Simple and end-to-end training of residual enhancement are introduced, allowing for accurate high-resolution garment images without retraining the entire network.
